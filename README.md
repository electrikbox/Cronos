# 💡 Introducing CronOS

## 🕝 Welcome to the CronOS project

**CronOS** is the result of the collaboration of **Olive t'Servrancx** & **Valentine Quignon** for our end-of-first-year portfolio at Holberton School, in Lille FRANCE. Before everything, you can take a loot at our [landing page](https://valpumpkins.github.io/cronos_landing_page/)

Very briefly, **CronOS** aims to simplify the management of crons in order to open up this great functionality to a public unfamiliar with this automated tasks system.

Our team set about designing and developing this platform with the mission of simplifying IT processes for everyone, while guaranteeing a fluid and secure user experience.

💨 A **[responsive page](https://valpumpkins.github.io/cronos_landing_page/)** that simply but effectively presents the product and what it can do for you. Whether in your browser or on your mobile, our [landing page](https://valpumpkins.github.io/cronos_landing_page/) remains functional and attractive !

💻 A **website section** where you can visualize 3 features of our project :

	- Functional and secure account creation form
	- Clear, intuitive dashboard to guide you every step of the way
	- Comprehensive and clear help center to answer all your questions

💿 A **App section** : a very important part of our project. Indeed, it's what links our website dashboard with the user's system. Without it, crons cannot be implemented ! You can see here 3 main parts of the app :

	- Login page
	- Main page with all the corresponding logs : what the application has done (created a cron, paused or deleted)
	- Main page cleared of all logs

👫 An **About section** introducing the two team members behind the project and the story behind its creation
