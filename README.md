# 💡 Introducing CronOS

## 🕝 Welcome to the CronOS project

**CronOS** is the result of the collaboration of **Olive t'Servrancx** & **Valentine Quignon** for our end-of-first-year portfolio at Holberton School, in Lille FRANCE. Before everything, you can take a loot at our [landing page](https://valpumpkins.github.io/cronos_landing_page/)

Very briefly, **CronOS** aims to simplify the management of crons in order to open up this great functionality to a public unfamiliar with this automated tasks system.

Our team set about designing and developing this platform with the mission of simplifying IT processes for everyone, while guaranteeing a fluid and secure user experience.
